     2  I want to die as the day declines,$
     3  at high sea and facing the sky,$
     4  while agony seems like a ^Idream^I$
     5  and my soul like a bird that can fly.$
$
     6  To hear not, at this last moment,^I$
     7  once alone with sky and sea,$
     8  any more voices nor weeping prayers$
     9  than the majestic beating of the waves.$
$
    10  To die when the sad light retires^I$
    11  its golden network from the green waves$
    12  to be like the sun that slowly expires;$
    13  something very luminous that fades.$
^I^I^I^I^I^I$
    14  To die, and die young, before$
    15  fleeting time removes the gentle crown,$
    16  while life still says: "I'm yours"$
    17  though we know with our hearts that she lies.$
